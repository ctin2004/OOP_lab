**About The Game** <br>
-
**Introduction** <br>

The game is based on the basic concept of the iconic platform game “Mario”, but instead of taking the same assets as the original game, our group has changed it into something dark, mysterious, and witchy to fit the name “Mysterious Journey”. In fact, we’ve learnt to make this game through instruction from the Youtuber “Kaarin Gaming” and also added some additional changes to make it our own game. <br>

**Rules** <br>

**Game Rules** <br>
The player must complete the levels by defeating all the enemies (the Crabs) while avoiding the obstacles and collecting the items to upgrade the character's status. <br>
