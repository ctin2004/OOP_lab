ep11:
- player not move in y-axis , now jump 
- refactor file res into ultiz since some devices(my devices) cannot read the file unexplicitly
- deleted the hitbox

 
ep20: fix 2 bugs:
bug 1: destroy container or box => spawn potions.
- arraylist potions in objectmana and level are the same one.

we got actual number of potions.
hit the box, container -> got potions. 
potions then added to the array.
when reset it supposes to reset the array
but the potions when hit the box now still in the array.

bug 2: spam attack the box, container => spawn a lot of potions which supposed to be appeared just once.

in checkObjectHit, when the hitbox intersect the box, it drop a new potion.
problem is the box animated and it still active.
=> add 1 more condition: that it is not in an animation: deactivated.

ADD TRAPS: spike: mũi nhọn, tên
- add spike class
- object manager changes

add player method: kill -> health = 0; -> die
